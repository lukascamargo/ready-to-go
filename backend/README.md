# Ready to Code NodeJS Backend

## About

This is a project to facilitate software development. To use it you should clone the project and then change the git url to what your project is going to use. 

In the future we may use NPM to install this project, change its name and change its git url. 

## Installation

Hey there.

To implement this backend service you should create a file named .env with the following variables:

```env
PORT=
DB_URI=
APP=
```

Where PORT is the port where the backend will run, DB_URI is the mongodb database URI and the APP is the application address.

Then, you should build the application before running it. To build the application you should have installed typescript globally.

```bash
tsc
```

You are ready to go.

```bash
npm run prod
```
